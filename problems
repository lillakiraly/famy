First, padding before the navbar and weird background behind the links - cannot remove 
    - solution: removed background-color from the * selector and put it into the body selector.
Second, how to make the whole svg clickable , not just the strokes and outline
Third, svgs keep their space (padding like) even if I set a max-width
Fourth, couldn't change the svgs' colors when :hover
    - solution: had to put path:hover
